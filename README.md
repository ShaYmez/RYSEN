## RYSEN DMRMaster+ ##
### A fork of the HBlink project ###

RYSEN DMRMaster+ - Software to build and scale DMR Master server software. Thanks to all thats credited in code, testing and develpment of this software. This software is completly open source and is derived from the orginal fork of HBlink3. Developed in PYTHON. A number of developers have contributed to the fork and I though the time is right to develop this version of the code completly out in the open.. as it should be. No private forks..Open Source. 

The base code is written by Cortney Buffington N0MJS and further develped by Simon G7RZU, Eric, K7EEL, Shane M0VUB & others. The RYSEN stack will now continue to be developed on GitHub where there is an oppourtunity to develop, maintain & fork with freedom!! This software can be used for networking in DMR. The code is freely availble but must retain all copyright and creditors in the base code. If using in the public domain please try to retain the copyright in your public dashboards or website. We can then see where the software is being used. A creditor notice example can be found at the bottom of this readme. 

Project under development!

More to come as development continues as a fork. - codename: RYSEN
